title: Stats I'm Picking Up
---

* **Error**  
The deviation of the observed value from the (unobservable) *true* value of a quantity of interest 
* **Residual**  
The deviation of the observed value from the *estimated* value of a quantity of interest 
* **Studentized Residual**  
The quotient resulting from the division of a residual by an estimate of its standard deviation
* **Likelihood Ratio Test**  
A statistical test used for comparing the goodness of fit of two models, one of which (the null model) is a special case of the other (the alternative model). The test is based on the likelihood ratio, which expresses how many times more likely the data are under one model than the other. 
* **Cooks Distance**  
Used estimate of the influence of a data point when performing a least-squares regression analysis.  Data points with large residuals (outliers) and/or high leverage may distort the outcome and accuracy of a regression. Cook's distance measures the effect of deleting a given observation. Points with a large Cook's distance are considered to merit closer examination in the analysis. 
* **Leverage**  
A measure of how far away the independent variable values of an observation are from those of the other observations
* ** **


* **Multi-Inheritance**  
A feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an object or class can inherit characteristics and features from more than one parent object or parent class. It is distinct from single inheritance, where an object or class may only inherit from one particular object or class.
* **Diamond Problem**  
An ambiguity that arises when two classes B and C inherit from A, and class D inherits from both B and C. If there is a method in A that B and C have overridden, and D does not override it, then which version of the method does D inherit: that of B, or that of C?  It only occurs when multi-inheritance is allowed.  Python mitigates this problem with an order of inheritance determined by the C3 linearization algorithm.  
* **Polymorphism**  
In English, polymorphism is the condition of occurring in several different forms.  
In computer science, polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types.  It comes in several flavors:  
  - *ad hoc polymorphism*:
  function overloading
  - *parametric polymorphism*:
  generic programming
