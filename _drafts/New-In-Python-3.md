* Function annotations
* the string formatting method
* comparisons of mixed types raises an exception
  - you can't sort [1, 2, 'spam']
* dictionary comprehen
* A lot of things that used to be lists are now iterables  
Examples: ranges, keys, zips 
  - must be cast to a list in order to print or sort
