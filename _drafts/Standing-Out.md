title: Encouragement for those in Tech that don't look the part  
---
It's an undeniable truth that I don't look like a stereotypical engineer.  

Not just because I'm a woman, but also because I'm American, and because I look pretty conventionally feminine. 

This is not the first time I've found myself in this situation.  

Nation-wide, math majors are about 60% male, but at Princeton, for various reasons outside the scope of this post, the number is close to 90%. In addition to being female, I'm very small and look about six years younger than I really am.  So even though I was a nineteen-year-old freshman, I was acutely aware that when I walked into my first Princeton math class, it looked to everyone else like a middle-school girl was inexplicably sneaking into their Real Analysis lecture.

But here's the thing: Inside, I *felt* like a math major.  During my freshman year of college, I thought about little else besides math.  

delete  <I don't condone competitions over who is the biggest minority because I think it promotes a victim mentality. But if all the math alums at Princeton got together and held a *Who looks Least like a Math Major* competition, I think I'd be a serious contender for the grand prize.>

So I've thought a lot about what it means to not look the part in the fields of math and technology: to be mistaken for my colleagues' HR rep or (worse) little sister. I'm here to share some encouraging and perhaps ground-breaking news: *It doesn't matter*.
