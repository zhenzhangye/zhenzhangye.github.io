title: On Mathematical Tidiness
---

Hopefully, you have had the experience of tackling an unfamiliar math problem where you didn't know the solution or even the general approach ahead of time. (If not, then the system has failed you.  Everyone should work on challenging math problems!) 

You grab a blank sheet of paper and scribble down the premise of the problem and anything else that comes to mind.  In the best case scenario, which we will call situation A, a light bulb will eventually click on, and a few equal signs later the answer will tumble onto the page in front of you.  Congrats!

In the worst case scenario, which we will call B, you will bang your against a wall, derive a few irrelevant truths like 1 = 1, forget what you were even solving for, and give up.  This experience, while unpleasant, is the only reliable way to improve as a mathematician.

As a tutor, I have the privilege of watching people tackle problems that are unfamiliar and challenging to them every single day.  My job is to minimize the amount of time my students spend chasing their tails and embarking down the wrong path by providing hints, and being a friendly and supportive presence :D.

I spend a lot of time thinking about why my students sometimes end up in situation A versus situation B.  It depends on a lot of factors, not least of which are intelligence, persistence, and a willingness to be wrong --  factors over which I have little control. One differentiating feature that struck me as I gained more experience tutoring was that some of my students' scratch paper was organized and legible while others worked in the margins of a scribbled, jumbled, mess.  

Because I'm not a particularly controlling or anal person, I wouldn't have expected this to bother me or to affect the learning process, but it did.  I found myself giving blunt, hyperspecific instructions to my messy students about how to utilize their paper: "start a new page so you have more room", "solve problems vertically not horizontally: write x = y + 5, then directly underneath it write x = 2y", "if you have to do a calculation use the margin so as not to disrupt the flow of the equations, but still write parallel to the bottom of the piece of paper".   

I used to think that the mess that people write on the page reflects the mess happening inside their heads: that they are dealing with concepts who nuances they do not understand and therefore can not cleanly translate into written form.  I thought it was my job to organize the mess in their heads, and that the paper they worked on would follow suit.  

I still believe this is true, but it is only part of the truth about the page in front of you.  The truth is that when you are working on a problem that you don't know how to solve, you can't possibly keep all the information and features of the problems in your head simultaneously.  (This is almost by definition; if you could, then you would probably know how to solve the problem.)  Therefore, my students are constantly rereading what they just wrote; they rely on their written work to inform their next move/decision.

So the mess in your head may contribute to the mess on the page, but the mess on the page further confounds the mess inside your head - it's a vicious cycle!  The most efficient way to break the cycle is to attack it from both ends. 

I am not a particularly tidy person in my personal life.  I leave dishes in the sink and throw my clothes on the floor.  My handwriting is legible but not uniform or beautiful.  I have no talent for sketching or painting.  

Mathematical tidiness is different from personal tidiness.  Mathematical tidiness is attention to detail and respect for logic and order.  Mathematical tidiness is trusting that the proper organization of the relevant mathematical structures will reveal the correct answer to the problem.  

I therefore have a zero tolerance policy towards mathematical messiness.  My students don't have to do their homework or pay attention in class.  But while we sit together they must be hypervigilant about the tidiness of their written work.  If this isn't possible, I think it's because their problems are in organization and effort, not in the mathematics, and I am probably not the right tutor for the job.
