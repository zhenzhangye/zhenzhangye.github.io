title: We Should All Be More Suspicious of Statistics
---

Statistics is an amazing field because it provides us with tools to estimate unknowable quantities. It's a big, complicated world out there, and every statistical study has limitations and uncertainties.

To this end, we should all become more discerning consumers of statistics.  We should refuse to quote statistics when we don't have 
infomation about how these statistics were calculated and the methodologies researchers used to collect data.  And we should treat a statistic without an accompanying standard error as the random variable that it is!

Here are some often-cited statistics of which I am skeptical:

* **"By 2100, the average U.S. temperature is projected to increase by about 3°F to 12°F, depending on emissions scenario and climate model".** {https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/science/future.html}  
Weather is an extremely chaotic system, which means that small changes in initial conditions (i.e., the weather right now) can lead to drastic changes in outcomes (i.e., weather forecasts in the future).  This is also known as the Butterfly Effect, because of the idea that a butterfly flapping its wings could cause a tornado across the world.  And this is why, even though multiple companies use supercomputers to measure temperature and air pressure across the surface of the earth, their forecasts for over 10 days out don't even beat historical averages.  Projecting into the future by extrapolating from recent yearly trends is a dangerous game; we have to be extremely careful and open about the assumptions we are making (usually dependent on the choice of model). So I'm highly skeptical of anyone who claims to predict weather in 100 years.  Note that this doesn't mean that I don't believe in the phenomenon of global warming, or the possibility of catastrophic climate change in our planet's future.  But I believe more strongly that we don't need to make up fake statistics to support real phenomena!  

* **Just 2% - 10% of rape accusations are false.** {https://icdv.idaho.gov/conference/handouts/False-Allegations.pdf}  

This statistic is egregious in so many ways; I'm just going take a deep breath and enumerate the fallacies one by one!

1. This statistic suffers from both numerator and denominator issues - namely, that we haven't indicated what counts as an "accusation" and who gets to decide whether or not it is false.  We'd have to limit the scope of our statement to "accusations formally filed at a University" or "accusations that go to trial in a court of law". And equally important, a study about a particular set of accusations doesn't necessarily have any predictive power over a case that wouldn't have qualified for inclusion in the study.  For example, a study examining only cases where there was a police investigation might be really bad at predicting the percentage of false allegations when there was no police investigation.  This is exactly the mistake that Sabrina Erdely, an editor at Rolling Stone, made when she claimed "that false rape reports account for, at most, eight percent of reports" in an article about an alleged gang rape at UVA that was *not* reported to the police.  
2. Just because an allegation wasn't found to be false doesn't mean that it was found to be true.  Let me explain.  The study linked above takes as its denominator accusations that the Northeastern Police Department investigated in the last 10 years.  This isn't so much a statistical fallacy as it is just straight-up misleading, verging scarily on lying.   
3. But even more insidious in the claim above is the assumption that, given enough time and resources, we could possibly estimate the percentage of false accusations at all.  Sex is sometimes a consenual act, unlike, say, murder or assault, so just because sex happened does not mean that a rape occurred. And determining whether consent was given between two adults, one or both of whom were intoxicated, usually lies somewhere between difficult and impossible.  Of course, there are cases that are less gray, like the incident involving Brock Turner at Stanford, but those cases are the exception and not the rule.  So the percentage of rape of accusations that are false is an unknowable quantity, and just like the weather in 100 years, is extremely difficult to estimate. In fact, the only thing that I am quite certain of is that the number is greater than 2%.  
This is not to say that support groups should treat alleged victims with suspicion.  But policemen, and judges, and college deans should.  

* **Women earn 77 cents for every dollar that men make.**  
This is probably the most legitimate statistic of the three, in that numbers in the high 70s / low 80s are supported by several credible studies, so taken at face value this statement is fairly accurate. However, the number is misleading because it doesn't take into account the fact that women are more likely than men to work in lower-paying industries and to log fewer hours at their job per week.  Additionally, "women" and "men" are such large and diverse groups; when we condition on, say, age, the gap can shrink or reverse!  So when we condition on age, hours worked, and career choice, we might attach a much different narrative on the numbers than the simplistic "women get paid 23% than men because of sexism".  

* Increasing the minimum wage can create jobs. Alternatively: Increasing the mininmum wage can make companies paying the higher wages better off.  
* 

And finally, a plea:

If you are making a claim, and your claim is factual or reasonable, do not back up your claim with false or misleading statistics.  Doing so will cause me to believe that your claim is neither factual nor reasonable.  

When we make a factual or reasonable claims, we shouldn't have to back it up with false or misleading data.
